So far, I am the only one who has written code for this project, but more are on the way. As well, the project is currently utilizing my personal domain.

A little about me:

Born in New York, but grew up in New Hampshire. Went to Rutgers and currently reside in New Jersey. Loves watching sports: big fan of the Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots. In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis (Fed is the GOAT), I am a fan of Star Wars media, and I love learning about random stuff. Today, I learned about the Mantis Shrimp, what a beast!
