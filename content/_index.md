EVChargerFinder is an ongoing project. The main incentive behind building this project is to provide a resource for drivers of EV vehicles to find an EV charger in their area. There are currently a few options in this regard, but most of them are incomplete: typically they only contain charging stations from their own network or are otherwise not reliable. We seek to change this by utilizing a neutral charging station source and offering higher flexibility by retrieving pertinent information from the networks themselves.
